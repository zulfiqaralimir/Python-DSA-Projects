### Title: "I Have Solved 554 LeetCode Problems, But You Don't Have To: Focus on These 8 Patterns Instead"

---

### Introduction
The speaker discusses the realization that solving 500+ LeetCode problems isn't necessary for mastering coding interviews. Instead, focusing on common patterns that frequently appear can significantly improve problem-solving skills.

### 1. Sliding Window Pattern
- **Concept**: Process a sequence of data elements by maintaining a window of a fixed size.
- **Use Case**: Problems involving finding subsets of elements that satisfy certain conditions.
- **Example**: Longest substring with K unique characters.

### 2. Subset Pattern
- **Concept**: Explore all possible combinations of elements from a given set.
- **Use Case**: Generating permutations or combinations.
- **Example**: Permutations problem on LeetCode.

### 3. Modified Binary Search Pattern
- **Concept**: Adjust the standard binary search logic to fit specific problem conditions.
- **Use Case**: Problems where the array is modified or has unique properties.
- **Example**: Search in a rotated sorted array.
- **Tip**: Implement bisect functions to improve understanding of binary search.

### 4. Top-K Elements Pattern
- **Concept**: Select K elements from a larger dataset based on a specific condition.
- **Use Case**: Finding top-ranking elements.
- **Example**: Kth largest number in an array.
- **Tool**: Use a heap data structure for efficiency.

### 5. Depth-First Search (DFS) of a Binary Tree
- **Concept**: Traverse a binary tree by exploring each branch fully before moving to the next.
- **Use Case**: Problems involving traversal or finding specific properties of binary trees.
- **Example**: Maximum depth of a binary tree.

### 6. Topological Sort
- **Concept**: Arrange elements in a specific order based on dependencies.
- **Use Case**: Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) with prerequisite relationships.
- **Example**: Course schedule problem.
- **Analogy**: Ordering modules in a complex program based on dependencies.

### 7. Breadth-First Search (BFS) of a Binary Tree
- **Concept**: Traverse a binary tree level by level.
- **Use Case**: Problems requiring level-order traversal.
- **Example**: Level order traversal of a binary tree.
- **Tool**: Use a queue data structure.

### 8. Two-Pointer Pattern
- **Concept**: Use two pointers to iterate through a sorted array efficiently.
- **Use Case**: Problems involving finding pairs or triplets that meet certain criteria.
- **Example**: Two-sum problem in a sorted array.
- **Tip**: Move pointers smartly based on the target condition.
